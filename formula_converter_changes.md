# Excel Formula Converter Fixes

The following changes were made to fix issues with the Excel formula to Python/pandas converter:

## 1. Fixed AND/OR Function Handling

### In `excel_formula_converter.py`:

- **Improved the `_translate_and` and `_translate_or` methods:**
  - Added parentheses around each condition before joining
  - Ensured each condition is properly wrapped as a pandas Series

- **Enhanced the `_process_argument` method:**
  - Added parentheses around argument expressions with comparison operators
  - Ensures proper operator precedence

- **Added post-processing in the `convert` method:**
  - Implemented regex patterns to fix:
    - Missing operators between conditions
    - Improper handling of multi-word column names
    - Missing parentheses for proper operator precedence
  - Added emergency fix for AND/OR issues that persist after initial fixes

## 2. Fixed Multi-word Column Handling

- **Added regex patterns to properly quote multi-word column names:**
  - Fixed unquoted spaces in column names
  - Improved multi-word column detection

## 3. Improved Error Handling

- **Enhanced syntax validation:**
  - Better error messages for invalid syntax
  - Added backup fixes when invalid syntax is detected

## 4. Added OR Function in Parser

- **In `excel_formula_parser.py`:**
  - Added implementation of `_process_or_function`
  - Matched the improved structure of the AND function handler
  
- **Improved the AND function handler:**
  - Better handling of multiple conditions
  - Proper series conversion for boolean operations

## Expected Results

With these changes, the following formulas should now work properly:

- `AND(Status="Active", Value>100)` - Previously generated invalid Python syntax
- `OR(Status="Inactive", Value<60)` - Better handling of OR conditions
- Multi-word column references like `Risk Level` with spaces
- Nested logical functions with multiple conditions

These improvements make the Excel formula converter more robust and able to handle a wider range of Excel formulas.
